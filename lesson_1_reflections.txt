How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped me to find and fix the bug saving manual work to compare two different files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily get access to all changes in the files and restore back to original if required. This save lot of time and help manage the files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Before commiting its good to reconfirm code which will save time in case of issue. Additionally you have control over when to commit, making it right and timely commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
